# application-cross-platform-material-template
A collection of node modules, needed for a cross-platform application with angular as app-engine and angular-material as design.

## included node-modules
* electron
* express
* socket.io
* swig

## included client-libraries
* angular-js
* angular-material

## features
* running cross-platform application (with electron)
* client-server connection for the communication with the gui (is not native supported by electron, so I'm using express)
* template-engine called swig (similar to php-twig, actually the best template-engine in my eyes)
* client-application built with angular to guarantee good user experience
* nice material-design-frontend, based on the angular-material project
* amazing implementation in good faith
* ready-to-use: everything is implemented yet, just add your code, that's it
* open-source and free to use (note the module-licences)

## usage
1. this requires node and npm (check https://nodejs.org/)
2. clone the git repository or copy the source-files by hand
3. execute the command: `npm install && npm start` in your project directory
4. have fun and write your own application
